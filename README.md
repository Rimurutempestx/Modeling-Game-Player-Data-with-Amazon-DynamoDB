## Overview
"Imagine you are building an online multiplayer game, such as a battle royale game. In your game, groups of 50 players join a session to play a game, which typically takes around 30 minutes to play. During the game, you have to update a specific player’s record to indicate the amount of time the player has been playing, the number of kills they’ve recorded, or whether they won the game. Users want to see old games they’ve played, either to view the games’ winners or to watch a replay of each game’s action."
